# 🟪 SubSplit

### **"Because your clips deserve more than subtitles thrown on with a prayer."**

**SubSplit** is a dark-mode-only, GPU-aware, multi-threaded subtitle generation tool built for content creators who are tired of basic captions—and even more tired of doing it manually.

Powered by [OpenAI's Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper), SubSplit doesn’t just transcribe. It:

- 🧠 Detects who’s talking (yes, multiple speakers—imagine that).
- 🎨 Assigns each speaker a unique color (because you’re not a robot).
- 🖋️ Embeds clean, stylized subtitles back into your video.
- 📂 Supports multiple video/audio files at once.
- 🖱️ Offers drag-and-drop ease with real-time ETA tracking.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🎤 **Diarization** — Separate speakers like a courtroom drama.  
- 🎨 **Color-coded Subtitles** — Each voice gets its own shade.  
- 🧪 **Custom Whisper Settings** — Choose model, temp folder, language.  
- 📁 **Multi-file Support** — Process chaos in bulk.  
- 🧠 **Error Logs** — Because things break and you deserve answers.  
- 💻 **Dark Mode Only** — If you use light mode, this isn’t for you.  
- 🐢 **Built for Creators** — Especially the broke, the tired, and the allergic to Premiere Pro.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Python** (obviously)  
- **Whisper** (for transcribing)  
- **PyQt6** (UI... for now 👀)  
- **FFmpeg** (for all your .mp4 sins)  
- **You, panicking at 3AM** (optional but encouraged)

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dyhrr/SubSplit
cd SubSplit
pip install -r requirements.txt
python cli.py
```
  ❗ You’ll need Whisper + FFmpeg installed separately. Google is your friend. Or not. I’m not your dad.

## 📦 Roadmap

🔲 OBS Replay Buffer integration

🔲 Funny moment detection system

🔲 Full web version rewrite

🔲 Optional turtle mascot (probably cursed)

## 🐞 Known Issues
Whisper large model may break your Raspberry Pi and your spirit.

UI is “functional” but not emotionally supportive (yet).

No unit tests (yet). Sue me.
